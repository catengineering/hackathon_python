Instructions on how to run these tests
======================================

This archive contains code to interact with an offeror' cloud provider, and
preform a very basic set of checks in a vendor-agnostic way.

Overview
--------

To make it as easy as possible on the offeror, this component of the demo
should only require the modification of the `vendor.py` file.

Modifications outside this file are discouraged, but may be acceptable if there
is a good reason for that modification.

Python 3
--------

All submissions must run under Python 3.

Dependencies
------------

sqlalchemy paramiko colorama

Running tests
-------------

```
python3 main.py
```
